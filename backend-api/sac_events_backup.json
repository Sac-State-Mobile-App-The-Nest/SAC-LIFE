    "eventDescriptions": "The 31st annual MCE conference is an invitation to collectively reflect on the ways in which we can heal from the violences reproduced through dominant educational institutions and to find respite and hope through community-rooted pedagogies (Serrano et al., 2022). We believe it is imperative to gather to learn from the rich wisdom of cultural knowledge, practices, pedagogies of the home (Delgado Bernal, 2001) and pedagogies that exist within our communities. We know that education can be a space a flourishing when we lean on culturally rooted and affirming practices that create belonging, relevance, and restorative educational spaces. We invite you, current students, staff, faculty, alumni, community educators and organizers to consider how you are cultivating healing-spaces in your own educational contexts so that we may learn from one another. In envisioning this theme, we were inspired by the questions: How do we heal from the violences that are reproduced through dominant modes of schooling? How do we co-create and sustain our freedom dreams? What pedagogies support a praxis of healing and freedom dreaming?"

At the same time, it can be challenging to keep up with the seemingly constant stream of news, disasters, and troubling events that happen on a daily basis.
